/**
 * A class Binary defines a recursive function to convert a binary number into its equivalent decimal number. 
 * Example let binary no. 1011, its equivalent decimal no. is 13. The details of the class are given below.
 * Class name : Binary
 * Data members : bin and dec as long integer.
 * Member functions :
 * void readBin() : to read a binary number.
 * Long convertDec(long) : to convert the binary number stored in bin into its equivalent decimal using recursive technique.
 * Storethe decimal number into dec and return.
 * Void show() : to display the binary and its equivalent decimal numbe
